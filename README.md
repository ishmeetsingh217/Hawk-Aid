# Hawk-Aid

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements and functionalities of the app Hawk Aid, a group project developed by the project team for the Fall 2020 CP470 class. Our main goal is to provide a minimalist course-note-taking application that provides all necessities in a very minimal fashion. Due to the pandemic occurring, a lot of teaching has been happening over the internet. We realized it is difficult for students to stay organized throughout a semester due to the pandemic and we also realized the current note taking apps in the market don’t really focus on students' needs; that’s where Hawk Aid comes in.

It was created for the project team to reference during all development phases, as well as the Client, Abdul-Rahman Mawlood-Yunis.

1.2 Scope
The scope of the mobile app “Hawk Aid” is to help the students make notes for specific courses and add all their courses along with the course specific notes in one app. We aim to develop an app which can help students create notes all in just one app and refer back to them whenever they want. People of all ages can use Hawk Aid to save their important notes.
Hawk Aid will provide a minimalistic view for taking course-notes, organizing notes, preparing for tests/exams while also reminding you for your next up-coming deadline to avoid any penalties. Essentially, Hawk Aid is a minimalistic course-based notes app that entirely focuses on course-related note-taking.
1.3 Stakeholders

Hawk Aid is designed to aid people that consider themselves as disorganized. This application will keep track of your course notes and send you timely reminders to keep you on track. Students will be able to increase their productivity through the use of this app. They will be able to better organize their notes, maintain due dates and other course work. Hawk Aid will allow students to add courses and maintain an efficient record of their course content. Teachers will also be able to make use of this application to keep their course content organized.


1.4 Inspiration 

We as students find it difficult to keep notes for every specific course organized and maintain our deadlines. There was a need for an android app that can keep an organized record of all of our course content at one place to be able to refer back to as well as remind us for any  upcoming deadlines. 

Also, as stated above, due to the recent pandemic we had a new motive to create an App that will not only change the way you take notes but also to stay productive and ahead of your courses by having your syllabus by your side and having some friendly reminders for any up-coming due dates and deadlines!
1.5 Overview
Hawk Aid is designed to make students’ lives easier. Students will be able to view all of their course notes and its contents on one device. Hawk Aid will alert students of the upcoming due date to avoid delay in submissions. It will maintain an efficient record of each student, their course work and their reminders.
 
2. Description
2.1 Product Perspective
Hawk Aid is an android app that will be created to help students organise their notes at one place. As shown in the screenshots, it’s an app which allows students to add their courses and start creating / viewing notes intended for that course; it also provides the course related information such as due dates and exam days, etc. Students can add / remove their courses whenever needed and it will also have the stability to remind students to start preparing for any up-coming tests and quizzes (Whether the specific entry is added to the Calendar or not for reminder purposes). Overall, it will be a nice clean and simplistic App intended for students without all the extra notification; simplistically and aesthetically pleasing is what we are aiming for.
